## Feature Overview
![](media/55GroupProjectUML.jpg)
Making it convenient to add new ingredients to ITALIAN CHEF.

At the moment, if some developer wants to add new ingredients to the game, they would need to write new code in every single file in the program. The idea is to change methods/classes in order to make the experience of adding new ingredients to the game more convenient. After the changes, only to lines of code will need to be written, facilitating the process of adding ingredients to the game for both new developers and people with no experience at coding.

## Pseudocode

ToppyingType.java

        create a static array that maintains an ordered collection of sound files names, matching the enum class order
        create a static array of size equal to the number of ingredients, that maintains an ordered collection of integers/counters, matching the enum class order 
        
        
 /* This method receives a integer as input and matches the input with the ingredients names based on their enum position */
 
        public static ToppingType TypeName(int i)
          "n" case matches with ingredient on "n" enum position and returns it
          if case is not matched, by default return rock
        
  
/* This method simply initializes the array thats keeps track of how many times each ingredient type was sliced based on the ingredients enum position */

        public static void initArray()
          create new array that has same size as the sound file array
          initialize each element of the array to zero
  
  
  
 Mode.java
 
/* This method based on a preset probability, first selects if a topping, hazard or upgrade is going to be generated and tossed into the screen. After, another random generator selects what exact type of topping/hazard/upgrade is going to be generated and displayed on the screen. */

        public void generateObject()
          if timer is not running returnnothing
          
          randomly picks a number between 1-100
          if number is < 71
            randomly choose between 0-topping type count array
            generate an ingredient based on the chosen number and its enum position
            add topping to the topping array

          if number is > 70 and < 86
            randomly selects either can or pineapple
            add hazard to the topping array

          if number is > 85
            if current game mode = timer Mode
              if no rock was cut
                randomly selects either clock or rock
                add the upgrade to the topping array
              if rock was cut and chosen number is even
                generate a clock 
                add clock to the topping array
            if not in Timer mode
              if the chosen number is even and no rock was cut
                generate a rock 
                add rock to the topping array

GameOver.java

/* This method is responsible for receiving information of how many of each topping was cut and randomly placing images of the cut topping inside the game over pizza that is later displayed to the user showing all the ingredients that were sliced during the round */

        private void addToppings()
          create a vector of pairs that store ingredient type and how many times it was sliced

          while the vector of pair size is not zero
            randomly generate a number from 0-size of topping type count array
            randomly generate coordinated to place the images inside the pizza

            decrease the topping counter by one

/* This method generates a vector of pairs. The key of the pair is the topping type and the value is the topping type slice count */

            if the value is different from zero
                add pair to the vector of pairs
